## Growth Mindset

My explanation of growth mindset goes here...

- I don't know yet, but I will!
- If I don't know something, I can always ask questions!
  - Don't be afraid to ask questions
  - No such thing as a dumb question.
  - Someone else might have the same question.
- Keep trying different things! Dont give up.
