## Growth Mindset

Growth Mindset is learning 100's of ways to fail to find one way to succeed. It's believing you can achive anything with practice. It's learning not to give up on the first try.

### Reminders ###

- I don't know yet, but I will!
- If I don't know something, I can always ask questions!
  - Don't be afraid to ask questions
  - No such thing as a dumb question.
  - Someone else might have the same question.
- Keep trying different things! Dont give up.
