# What are four important features to look for in a text editor?

1. code completion
2. syntax highlighting
3. a nice variety of themes to reduce eye strain and fatigue.
4. the ability to choose from a healthy selection of extensions available when you need them.

# What do the following commands do?

1. (pwd) stands for ***"Print Working Directory"***
2. (ls) stands for ***"List"*** for short.
3. (cd) stands for ***"Location".***
4. mkdir
5. touch

Can you explain what is happening in the following scenario if these commands and arguments are entered into the command line? (Arguments are extra instructions given to a command.)

- ***cd projects***: This command takes you inside a folder named "projects".
- ***mkdir new-project***: This command creates a new folder called "new-project" inside the "projects" folder.
- ***touch new-project/newfile.md***: This command creates a new file called "newfile.md" inside the "new-project" folder.
- ***cd ..***: This command takes you back to the previous folder (the parent folder) from the "projects" folder.
- ***ls projects/new-project***: This command shows you a list of files and folders inside the "new-project" folder located within the "projects" folder.
