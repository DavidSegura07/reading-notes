# Class 2 notes

## What are four important features to look for in a text editor?

1. code completion
2. syntax highlighting
3. a nice variety of themes to reduce eye strain and fatigue.
4. the ability to choose from a healthy selection of extensions available when you need them.

## What do the following commands do?

1. (pwd) stands for ***"Print Working Directory"***
2. (ls) stands for ***"List"*** It is used to list the files and directories (folders) in the current directory. When you enter this command, it displays the names of the files and folders present in the current directory.
3. (cd) stands for ***"Change Directory"*** It is used to navigate between directories.
4. (mkdir) stands for ***"make directory"*** It is used to create a new directory. When you enter this command followed by a directory name, it creates a new folder with that name in the current directory.
5. (touch) The ***"touch"*** command is used to create a new file. When you enter this command followed by a file name, it creates an empty file with that name in the current directory. If the file already exists, it updates its timestamp without modifying its content.

## Can you explain what is happening in the following scenario if these commands and arguments are entered into the command line? (Arguments are extra instructions given to a command.)

- ***cd projects***: This command takes you inside a folder named "projects".
- ***mkdir new-project***: This command creates a new folder called "new-project" inside the "projects" folder.
- ***touch new-project/newfile.md***: This command creates a new file called "newfile.md" inside the "new-project" folder.
- ***cd ..***: This command takes you back to the previous folder (the parent folder) from the "projects" folder.
- ***ls projects/new-project***: This command shows you a list of files and folders inside the "new-project" folder located within the "projects" folder.
