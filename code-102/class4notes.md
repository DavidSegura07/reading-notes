## What is HTML and why do we use it?

 *What is HTML?* It's a language used to create the content and structure of web pages. It uses special tags enclosed in angle brackets (<>) to define different parts of the page, like headings, paragraphs, images, links, and more. With HTML, you can organize and present information on a web page in a structured way. It works alongside other technologies like CSS for styling and JavaScript for adding interactivity to make web pages look and behave the way they do.
