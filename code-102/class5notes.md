## What is the purpose of CSS?

The purpose of CSS (Cascading Style Sheets) is to style and format the appearance of HTML elements on a webpage. It allows you to control the layout, colors, fonts, and other visual aspects of your website.

## What are the three ways to insert CSS into your project?

- Inline CSS: You can apply CSS directly to individual HTML elements by using the "style" attribute.
- Internal CSS: You can define CSS rules within the style tags in the head section of your HTML file. This applies the styles to all elements on that particular HTML page.
- External CSS: You can create a separate CSS file with a .css extension and link it to your HTML file using the link tag.

## Write an example of a CSS rule that would give all elements red text?

> p {
  color: red;
}
