# Class 6 Notes

## What are variables in JavaScript?

Variables in JavaScript are like labeled boxes where you can put things. You give each box a name, and inside the box, you can store different types of information like numbers or words.

## What does it mean to declare a variable?

To declare a variable means to create it and give it a name. It's like reserving a storage space in memory to hold a value. When you declare a variable, you also specify its type, such as a number, string, or boolean.

## What is an “assignment” operator, and what does it do?

An "assignment" operator in JavaScript is the equal sign (=). It is used to assign a value to a variable. For example, x = 10 assigns the value 10 to the variable x. It takes the value on the right side and assigns it to the variable on the left side.

## What is information received from the user called?

Information received from the user in JavaScript is often referred to as "input" or "user input." This can be done using various methods, such as reading input from a form field, reading command-line arguments, or displaying prompts for the user to enter values.
