# Programming with JavaScript

## What is control flow?

Control flow refers to the order in which statements and instructions are executed in a program. It determines the path of execution, allowing you to make decisions, loop through code, and control the program's behavior based on conditions and user input.

## What is a JavaScript function?

In JavaScript, a function is a reusable block of code that performs a specific task or calculates a value. It allows you to group related code together and execute it whenever needed. Functions help in organizing and modularizing code, making it easier to understand, debug, and maintain.

## What does it mean to invoke - or call - a function?

Invoking or calling a function means to execute the code inside the function and perform the actions defined within it. When a function is invoked, the program jumps to the function's code, executes it, and then returns to where it was called from. To invoke a function, you use the function name followed by parentheses (). If the function accepts arguments, you can pass them inside the parentheses.

> function greet(name) {
  >console.log("Hello, " >+ name + "!");
}
> Function invocation
> greet("John");

## What are the parenthesis () for when you define a function?

The parentheses () in a function definition are used to declare the parameters that the function accepts. Parameters act as placeholders for values that will be passed to the function when it is invoked. They allow you to pass data into the function to perform operations or calculations with that data.
