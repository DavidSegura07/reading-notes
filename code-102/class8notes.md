# Operators and Loops

## What is an expression in JavaScript?

In JavaScript, an expression is a piece of code that produces a value. It can be a combination of variables, values, operators, and function calls that are evaluated to produce a result. Expressions can be as simple as a single value or can be complex combinations of multiple values and operators.

 Examples of JavaScript expressions:

>5 + 3 (evaluates to 8)
firstName + ' ' + lastName (concatenates two variables)
Math.max(10, 20, 30) (calls a function and returns the maximum value)

## Why would we use a loop in our code?

We use loops in our code to execute a block of code repeatedly until a specific condition is met. Loops are used to automate repetitive tasks and make the code more efficient. Instead of writing the same code multiple times, a loop allows us to iterate over a set of data or perform an action a certain number of times.

## When does a for loop stop executing?

A for loop stops executing when the specified condition inside the parentheses () evaluates to false. The condition is checked before each iteration of the loop. If the condition is initially false, the loop will not execute at all.

## How many times will a while loop execute?

The loop continues to execute as long as the condition remains true. Once the condition becomes false, the loop terminates, and the program continues with the next line of code after the loop.
