# What Went Wrong? Troubleshooting JavaScript

## Name some key differences between a Syntax Error and a Logic Error

    - Syntax Error: This happens when you make a mistake in writing your code, like forgetting to close brackets or misspelling words. It's like grammar mistakes in a sentence that prevent it from making sense.
    - Logic Error: This happens when your code is written correctly, but it produces unexpected or wrong results. It's like when you follow a recipe correctly, but the dish turns out tasting strange.

## List a few types of errors that you have encountered in past lab assignments and explain how you were able to correct them

**Types of errors and how they were corrected:**

    - Syntax errors: These were fixed by carefully checking the code for missing or wrong characters, like brackets or semicolons.
    - Type errors: These were resolved by checking if the data types used in the code matched correctly.
    - Logic errors: These were fixed by looking closely at the code's logic and step-by-step checking to find the mistake.

## How will this topic continue to influence your long term goals?

Troubleshooting JavaScript helps improve problem-solving skills and overall programming ability, which is important for long-term success as a developer.

# The JavaScript Debugger

## How would you describe the JavaScript Debugger tool and how it works to someone just starting out in software development?

The JavaScript Debugger is like a detective tool for finding and fixing mistakes in your code. It lets you pause your code at specific points to see what's happening step by step. It helps you understand why your code might not be working correctly.

## Define what a breakpoint is

A breakpoint is like a temporary stop sign in your code. When you set a breakpoint, your code pauses at that point so you can see what's going on and check variables or values.

## What is the call stack?

The call stack is like a stack of plates. When your code calls a function, it adds that function to the top of the stack. When the function finishes, it removes it from the top. It helps keep track of where your code is and what functions are being used.
