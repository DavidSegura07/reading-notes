# Video and Audio Content

## Explain how the ability to use video and audio on the web has evolved since the early 2000s.

Evolution of video and audio on the web since the early 2000s:
Back in the early 2000s, videos and audios on the web used special programs called plugins. But now, we can play videos and audios directly on web pages without plugins. The quality of videos and audios has improved, and we can easily share and stream them online.

## Describe the use of the src and controls attributes in the `<video>` element.

Use of the src and controls attributes in the `<video>`element:
The src attribute tells the web page where the video file is located, so it can be shown on the page. The controls attribute adds buttons to the video player, like play, pause, and volume control, so people can interact with the video.

## Why is it important to have fallback content inside the `<video>` element?

Importance of fallback content inside the `<video>` element:
Including fallback content is important because not all web browsers can play videos in the same way. Fallback content provides an alternative, like a text description or a link to download the video, for people who can't play the video or have disabled video playback.

## Write a very short story where `<audio>` and `<video>` are characters.

A Short Story with `<audio>` and `<video>` as Characters:

Together, they went on exciting adventures, taking people to different places through their stories. Audio sang lovely songs, and Video showed amazing scenes, creating a magical experience.

# Responsive Images

## Besides making a site visually appealing across different screen sizes, why should developers make images responsive?

Responsive images are not just about looking good. They help websites work well on different devices and screen sizes. They make sure images fit nicely on screens without causing problems, and they save data and make pages load faster.

## Define the following `<img>` attributes srcset and sizes. Write an example of how they are used.

    - srcset attribute: It tells the browser which image to use based on the device's capabilities. For example, a high-resolution image for devices with better screens and a lower-resolution image for normal screens.
    - sizes attribute: It helps the browser decide how big the image should be displayed on different screen sizes. For example, it can make the image take up the whole screen on small devices and only half the screen on larger devices.

## How is srcset more helpful for responsive images than CSS or JavaScript?

srcset is better because the browser knows which image to pick automatically. It saves time and makes things easier, without needing complicated code. It also saves data by loading the right-sized image, so websites load faster.
