# JavaScript Canvas

## What does the `<canvas>` allow a developer to acheive?

The `<canvas>` element allows a developer to create and manipulate graphics, animations, and interactive elements using JavaScript. It provides a drawing surface on a web page where you can dynamically render shapes, images, and text.

## What is the importance of the closing `</canvas>` tag?

The closing `</canvas>` tag is important because it tells the browser where the canvas element ends. It ensures that the canvas is properly defined and can be accessed and manipulated using JavaScript.

## Explain what the getContext() method does.

The getContext() method is used to obtain the rendering context and its drawing functions for a`<canvas>`element. It allows you to specify the type of context you want (2D or 3D) and provides a JavaScript object that represents the chosen rendering context. This object contains various methods and properties for drawing and manipulating graphics on the canvas.
