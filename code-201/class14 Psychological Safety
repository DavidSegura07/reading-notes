## What are three key factors that contribute to psychologically safe teams?

- Trust means team members feel safe to share their thoughts and ideas without being judged or punished. It helps them take risks and communicate openly.

- Open communication means creating an environment where people can freely express their thoughts and concerns. It encourages teamwork, problem-solving, and innovation.

## Evaluate, with details, a previous professional setting (or team) you were in with regards to psychological safety.
