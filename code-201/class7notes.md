# Domain Modeling

## Explain why we need domain modeling.

Domain modeling helps us create a representation of real-world things and their relationships in a specific problem. It helps us understand and design software systems that accurately reflect the problem we're solving.

# HTML Table Basics

## Why should tables not be used for page layouts?

Tables shouldn't be used for page layouts because they can cause problems for accessibility and search engine optimization. HTML provides other elements and CSS techniques that are better suited for organizing page layouts.

## List and describe 3 different semantic HTML elements used in an HTML <table>.

```<caption>: It gives a title or description to the table.```
```<thead>, <tbody>, <tfoot>: They structure the table's content into header, body, and footer sections.```
```<th>: It represents a header cell in the table, usually used for column or row headers.```

# Introducing Constructors

## What is a constructor and what are some advantages to using it?

Constructors are special methods used to create and set up objects based on a blueprint. They allow us to define how an object should be created and what initial values it should have.

## How does the term this differ when used in an object literal versus when used in a constructor?

Object Initialization: Constructors help set initial values for object properties.
Encapsulation: Constructors keep object creation and initialization logic organized.
Code Reusability: Constructors let us create multiple objects with different initial values easily.
