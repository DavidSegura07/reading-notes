# Learn CSS - Flexbox

## Flexbox is designed for one-dimensional content. Explain what this means.

Flexbox is a way to arrange elements on a webpage either horizontally or vertically. It focuses on arranging elements in a single line, like a row or a column.

## Explain the difference between the main axis and cross axis.

The main axis is the primary direction in which the elements are placed, either horizontally or vertically. The cross axis is the perpendicular direction used for alignment and positioning of the elements.

## How can using certain properties of flexbox negatively impact accessibility?

Using certain properties of Flexbox incorrectly can make it harder for some people to use a website. For example, changing the order of elements visually may confuse those who rely on screen readers. Also, not providing fallbacks for older browsers can make the website inaccessible to some users.
