# HTML Forms

## *Your first Web Form. How To Structure A Web Form.*

## Why are forms so important in web development?

Forms are important because they allow users to interact with a website or app. They let users enter information, like usernames and passwords, and submit it to the website or app. This helps in things like logging in, sending messages, or making purchases.

## When designing a form, what are some key things to keep in mind when it comes to user experience?

When designing a form, make it simple and easy to use. Use clear labels and instructions, so users know what to do. Make sure the form looks good on different devices. Also, check that the information entered is valid and help users fix any mistakes.

## List 5 form elements and explain their importance.

- Input: It's like a blank box where users can type things like names or email addresses.
- Select: It's a drop-down list that gives users choices to pick from.
- Textarea: It's a bigger box where users can write longer messages or comments.
- Button: It's like a clickable button that performs an action when users click on it.
- Label: It's a text that describes what each input field is for, helping users understand what to enter.

## *Introduction To Events.*


## How would you describe events to a non-technical friend?

Events are like triggers that happen when you do something on a website, like clicking a button or submitting a form. They make things happen, like showing a message or changing what you see on the screen.

## When using the addEventListener() method, what 2 arguments will you need to provide?

When using addEventListener(), you need to tell it what event you want to listen for (like a click or keypress) and what to do when that event happens (like running a function).

## Describe the event object. Why is the target within the event object useful?

The event object has information about the event, like what happened and where it happened. The target tells you which part of the website triggered the event. It's useful because you can do different things based on which part of the website was interacted with.

## What is the difference between event bubbling and event capturing?

Event bubbling is like a ripple effect when an event happens on an element, it can also trigger events on its parent elements. Event capturing is the opposite, where events are triggered on parent elements first and then go to the target element.
